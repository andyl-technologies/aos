  body = "The crossmode fixture used a raw fork after QEMU's RCU constructor had started a worker. Its child could inherit qemu_hot_fork_thread_lock and block before emitting the migration stream, leaving the package check indefinitely waiting for its length prefix.\n\nSpawn the same test executable with posix_spawn so the real exact VMState writer runs without inherited QEMU thread state. Preserve all four producer scenarios and the original migration acceptance/refusal and timer assertions. Bound producer IPC to five seconds and isolated GLib test subprocesses to ten seconds, closing descriptors and reaping only the owned producer on failure.\n\nThe actual package worker was observed blocked on the registry mutex. All 21 corrected controls passed with the configured AOS compiler and existing native objects; a separate short original probe passed, so it is retained as a non-reproduction of the timing-dependent failure. The existing heap-owned hot-fork operation, protocol headers and production timer code remain unchanged.";
