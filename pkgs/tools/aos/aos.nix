  # Every external tool the aos/apm/apr binaries shell out to by bare name
  # (resolved via $PATH). The wrappers below set PATH to exactly this, so the
  # binaries are hermetic — their behavior never depends on the caller's
  # environment:
  #   git           registry, pack, and object-store operations
  #   nix           nix / nix-store: cache and store operations
  #   openssh       ssh-keygen, for `git -c gpg.format=ssh tag -s` release signing
  #   zstd          pack-delta compression and store decompression
  #   tar           extracting tree subpaths from `git archive` output
  #   which         check_command_exists() preflight in the drain/sysroot path
  # These are declared as runtimeDeps below (not just buildDeps) so the
  # scrubPhase keeps their store-path references in the wrappers and pulls them
  # into the runtime closure; without that, nuke-refs would rewrite these paths
  # to placeholders and the wrappers would point at nonexistent stores.
