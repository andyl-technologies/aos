# RFC-0025 implementation status

Implementation work tracks the full [RFC-0025](../../rfcs/0025-crucible-node-contract/README.md).
The PR remains draft. Component tests and separately qualified native profiles
do not establish completion of the full architecture.

This summary accompanies the [phased implementation plan](phased-implementation.md)
and [qualification plan](qualification-plan.md). Detailed test logs, images,
traces and experiment history remain local. Test counts below identify their
specific stage; they are not cumulative coverage of the latest source.

## Implemented areas

| Area | Implemented behavior | Remaining qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common node contract | Backend-neutral lifecycle, capabilities, graph admission, causal scheduling, owner exclusion and implementation-bound archives | Final-source checks and complete production routing |
| Existing execution | Shared campaign and attempt APIs with legacy compatibility aliases, canonical identities and separate observed provenance | Final legacy compatibility and performance comparison |
| Public providers | Authenticated CNP/1, extension negotiation, bounded control/evidence transfers, request journals and original pending-operation custody | Complete installed-source behavioral acceptance and vendor acceptance |
| Host models | Clock, source, Block, readonly 9p and network mechanisms; retained native state and original input lineage | Ordinary mixed-world service integration and complete conformance for each selected profile |
| QEMU | Process-separated native CPU/timer/control observations, original callback custody and matching corresponding source | Current ABI/license gates and full-scenario preservation |
| gem5 | Source-built x86/AArch64 models, process-separated controller, bounded journals and backend-bound continuation | Complete Linux device parity, common-node readiness and full-world preservation |
| Quantized execution | Nondeterminism propagation, explicit capabilities and KVM clock/timer mediation | Paced hardware execution and full KVM node qualification |

The Apache host and GPL-side QEMU/plugin remain separate processes, using
versioned socket/shared-memory protocols. QEMU publication retains the matching
complete corresponding source. Backend-neutral state cannot relabel a saved
backend implementation or upgrade observation data into execution authority.

## Verified checkpoints

### Shared runtime and public integration

Earlier committed stages exercise real public providers, connected-node routing,
original pending inputs, source retirement and fresh native continuations. The
CLI preservation stage also restarts through fresh daemon processes. Those
results apply to their recorded profiles and source revisions.

Original-owner capture budgets, bounded cleanup notification and collecting
restoration phases are committed in `dfd1c93c16`, with formatting separately in
`4feaa76dc2`. Normal four-crate/all-feature/all-target checking passes for that
stage. Fresh executables pass 83 selected controls: 62 Core, eighteen daemon and
three canonical-ACK integration cases, with no failures or ignored tests.
Earlier Waker-identity failures remain failures; the correction retains and
clones the same original Waker. These component controls do not qualify complete
native Capture or fresh restoration.

Provider storage projections and prepared Blob acknowledgement checks are
committed in `19b42f9d65`, with formatting separately in `15a7be2dec`. All 89
selected provider controls pass against the complete 435-file owned dependency
set. This checkpoint has no dependency on subsequent Core changes.

### Application compilation

The production compiler build and installed compiler verification pass. An
earlier mandatory application-target gate passes for the original-report,
deduplication and ARM-source checkpoint, compiling 167 test targets across all
48 selected application roots, including 69 integration targets. Independent
verification checks the actual compiler messages, captured source, artifact
roles and registered output. This gate compiles tests without executing them;
Crucible daemon runtime checks are separate.

A new gate is running against the original-owner preparation, Clock and BLAKE3
checkpoint below. It captures all 48 application roots and their sixty local
dependencies through the ordinary production source filter. Its result is
pending; the earlier 167-target result does not qualify these newer sources.

### QEMU package

The ordinary QEMU package passes 589 upstream TAP checks, 44 project model/cost
fixtures and 274 static predicates. Installed verification checks its exact
binary/source pair, retained source, licenses and aggregate-only publication
policy. This does not establish success of the current ABI/license gates or
full-scenario preservation.

### gem5 packages and Linux boot

Commit `9decfccd3f` shares Linux fixtures, binds profiles to captured recipes and
filters Python bytecode from host source inputs. Independent installed
verification passes for the filtered package and corresponding source, including
ten registrations, thirty reports, 162 joins, 154 host entries and 47 recipes.
The native compiler is unchanged. Host capture is cache-free; unopened upstream
archives have not been independently scanned.

Commit `48eefd89ea` lets the Linux check package select a four-second simulated
horizon while preserving the checker's two-second default. Two fresh x86 Linux
boots reach PID1 and produce identical 20,717-byte consoles, 3,174,768,710,000
ticks and 317,480,064 callbacks. Independent installed verification checks both
raw consoles and receipts, source copies and registered outputs. The bounded
package and eleven modeled controls pass.

Both earlier two-second boot failures remain failures. The instrumented failure
reaches current tick 1,999,999,990,000 with the next event at the exclusive
2,000,000,000,000-tick horizon. The four-second result qualifies Linux/PID1 boot
only. It does not qualify common-node readiness, Capture, restoration, CPU timing
fidelity or device parity. The published birth digest agrees across runs; the
complete birth-event archive was not retained for independent recomputation.

Earlier separately qualified x86/AArch64 model profiles exercise source removal,
two fresh continuations, resource-root relocation and fresh recapture. Those
profile-specific results do not establish full Linux preservation.

The ARM Linux check also passes two fresh native boots. Both reach the two PID1
markers at tick 201,523,590,000 with 12,952,448 callbacks and identical
18,858-byte consoles. Installed verification checks both receipts and consoles,
the source copies and registered outputs. Loader geometry and console controls
pass. These results qualify the selected Linux/PID1 workload; common-node
readiness, capture, restoration and complete device parity remain outstanding.

### Original-owner preparation and Clock continuation

Commit `a836c25274` observes retained host and provider storage before
preparation, retains original query and Prepare owners, and connects Clock
continuation to the common node interfaces. Backend-neutral capability
accessors preserve the legacy positional encoding and compatibility diagnostics.
Normal five-crate, all-feature/all-target checking passes.

Fresh normal executables pass 312 selected controls: 104 Core, 154 provider and
54 daemon cases, with no failures or ignored tests. The Core and provider sets
retain all 71 and 120 earlier regression bodies respectively, alongside the new
storage, Prepare and Clock controls. Independent review verifies the Core and
daemon source, executable, dependency and original wait records. These are
component checks; complete native Capture and restoration remain outstanding.

The full archive-admission case now passes in 87.83 seconds under its original
120-second limit. The earlier timeout remains a failed historical checkpoint.
A preceding executable also passed that archive case in 83.14 seconds, but
failed one positive fixture during setup: it selected the original 512 MiB
policy before reaching its intended missing-preparation refusal. The current
fixture explicitly selects the existing finite 768 MiB positive policy. Its
refusal assertions and the separate 512 MiB negative controls are unchanged.

## Work in progress

Packet startup/report, capture and restoration storage accounting is committed
in `196c68fd91`, with formatting separately in `5f2586267f`. Normal five-crate,
all-feature/all-target checking passes. A fresh daemon executable passes 34
selected controls, including all five corrected startup cases, two new
fixture/policy controls, original finite-bound negatives, and alias/drift checks.
At that checkpoint, the full archive-admission case exceeds its original
120-second budget in isolation. The later passing result is recorded above.

An earlier original-report/storage stage passes 196 selected controls: two
campaign, 120 provider, 71 Core and three integration cases. Its five startup
failures and archive timeouts remain recorded as failures at that stage.

The startup fixture originally selected a 512 MiB policy. A recorded census at
a 16 KiB negotiated message window projects 606.9 MiB for that checkpoint's
actual executable and retained reports. Its diagnostic confirms refusal after
restoring the original 512 MiB policy. The positive fixture now selects a finite
768 MiB policy; its runtime cases pass. The explicit 64 KiB-window/512 MiB
negative and production accounting remain intact.

A later archive run finishes with a missing immutable Host continuation definition.
The fixture now supplies the pinned definition, checks transitive content closure,
and explicitly accepts all four actual unqualified participants. New controls
reject missing or mismatched definition bytes, omitted participants, extras,
duplicates and noncanonical ordering. The later full admission test passes;
complete native Capture and restoration are separate outstanding gates.

Archive validation shares completed full hashes of exact aliases within one
pass while retaining every descriptor/path fence and sticky refusal. The next
pass hashes again. Ten aliases require one full measurement per pass, and all
four alias/inode/media/drift controls pass. Full-file streams now use 256 KiB
blocks, with the complete scratch allocation accounted at each owning boundary.
A matched mechanics experiment measures a 23.65% mean reduction against 64 KiB
blocks with identical framed hashes. This does not establish daemon or Linux
boot speedup. Commit `95297b8681` additionally selects the pinned BLAKE3
library's runtime-detected intrinsics while retaining framed hash bytes. Thirty
balanced three-way rounds over the same 160.8 MB file measure median hash times
of 77.11 ms for the original 64 KiB/pure configuration, 58.01 ms for 256 KiB/pure,
and 35.56 ms for 256 KiB/intrinsics. The combined reduction is 53.89%; all ninety
full hashes and 55 boundary vectors match. These cache-hot hashing measurements
do not establish an overall Linux-boot improvement or an ARM-host result.

Further source work covers original allocation admission before native startup,
full Prepare/report publication, same-owner query budgets, the ordinary Clock
qualification route and mixed-world service integration. Source review of those
changes does not establish execution or native qualification. Missing original
owners, unknown storage and unavailable baseline/native prerequisites continue
to refuse.

## Known gaps and exit criteria

Completion requires the full [qualification plan](qualification-plan.md),
including:

- Complete native Capture, original source/resource removal and two independent
  fresh-world restorations with exact continuation.
- Production backend routing, mixed native execution, device parity and public
  vendor acceptance for every advertised operating mode.
- Final-source application test-target compilation, relevant ABI/license gates,
  and adverse state, timing, ownership and causality tests.
- Paced KVM qualification. Its selected CREATE still refuses before allocation,
  with only one of eleven required coverage bits implemented. Complete
  DMTCP/kernel qualification also remains outstanding.
- A clean final strict Clippy run. The current run stops at 59 provider errors,
  mostly unused methods and fields awaiting their production callers; deeper
  crates remain unchecked. The four-vCPU ABI timer-deadline divergence also
  remains unresolved.
- Quiet final Linux comparisons against fresh origin/master, plus same-binary
  TCG+icount versus SIM with both set to 50 ps/instruction.

## Performance results

| Measurement | Result | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gem5 address-range predicate | 5.26x median improvement; one million allocations removed per round | Five matched lookup rounds with identical checksums |
| gem5 thread-list transitions | 2.55x median improvement; 500,000 allocations removed per round | Five matched list-mechanics rounds |
| QEMU/plugin Linux boot, six matched runs | Median 29.50669 to 29.54280 seconds (+0.12%) | Frozen controller, same guest and 50 ps/instruction; effectively flat |
| Full-file hash stream, 64 to 256 KiB blocks | 23.65% lower mean time | Thirty matched rounds over the same 160.8 MB file; identical framed hashes |
| Full-file hash stream and runtime-selected BLAKE3 intrinsics | Median 77.11 to 35.56 ms; 53.89% lower time | Thirty balanced three-way rounds; all ninety full hashes and 55 boundary vectors match |
| Maximum-frontier component pair | 3.37x improvement | One matched component pair |
| Immutable-domain component pair | 47.87x wall and 55.92x child CPU improvement | One matched component pair |

Component results do not add up to an overall Linux-boot speedup claim. The final
comparison must use the same guest bytes, clock policy and workload, preserve
complete deterministic witnesses, record interventions and retain all samples.
