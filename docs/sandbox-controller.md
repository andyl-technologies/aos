# Sandbox controller endpoints

The packaged controller currently publishes broker inventory and exposes
discovery. It does not yet admit or execute public mutations. Controller
readiness confirms its initial authenticated catalog cycle, not completion of
RFC-0021 or readiness to run sandboxes.

## Registered TLS discovery

The optional endpoint is `/run/aos/sandboxd/public.sock`. It carries TLS 1.3
with mandatory client certificates and HTTP/2 ALPN; it is not a plaintext Unix
HTTP endpoint. Only `DiscoveryService` is registered there. The existing
`diagnostics.sock` remains restricted to root by kernel peer credentials.

After configuring the controller, its node identity, and all four broker
sessions, enable public discovery with external system credentials:

```nix
aos.sandbox.controllerService = {
  publicApi.enable = true;
  credentials = {
    publicApiServerCert = "sandbox-api-server-cert";
    publicApiServerKey = "sandbox-api-server-key";
    publicApiClientCa = "sandbox-api-client-ca";
    publicApiPrincipals = "sandbox-api-principals";
  };
};
```

These values name credentials supplied under `/run/credentials/@system/`;
they are not paths to repository files or Nix-store secrets. Provision private
keys outside the repository and store. systemd loads them into the service's
private credential directory using these fixed names:

| Fixed credential | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `public-api-server-cert` | PEM server certificate chain |
| `public-api-server-key` | Matching PEM private key |
| `public-api-client-ca` | PEM client trust anchors |
| `public-api-principals` | Closed version-1 JSON registration document |

The registration document has `version: 1` and a nonempty `peers` array. Each
entry has exactly `certificate_sha256`, `principal`, and `project`.
`certificate_sha256` is the SHA-256 digest of the client's leaf certificate
DER, encoded as an array of exactly 32 byte integers. Principal and project
are nonzero canonical lowercase hyphenated UUID strings. Duplicate certificate
digests, unknown fields, and more than 4,096 entries are rejected. Each
credential is limited to 1 MiB.

Registration identifies a client; it grants no capability or mutation
authority. A trusted certificate without an exact registration is rejected.
Request identity headers cannot replace connection metadata. The service
rechecks the registered peer before and after each discovery handler.

## Activation and rotation

Enabling the endpoint requires all four credentials. Invalid credential
custody or content fails startup before readiness. The endpoint admits at most
32 connections and eight concurrent handshakes. Handshakes have a ten-second
budget; peer authorization has a five-minute BOOTTIME lifetime. Pending I/O
also has expiry wake-ups, and every I/O poll checks BOOTTIME.

Credential changes invalidate retained peer evidence. The acceptor does not
hot-reload credentials: install replacements through the external credential
mechanism and restart the controller. Before restarting, reconcile pending
protected broker-session history; never erase its journal to bypass recovery.

The public endpoint has no CLI client integration or mutation handlers yet.
Its deployed credential lifecycle and end-to-end RPC behavior still require
qualification. See the [production integration audit](rfcs/0021-sandbox-runtime/16-implementation-tasks.md#production-integration-audit)
for the remaining activation work.
